                OxSchnick is a game where Oxford students can challenge each other to Schnicks (aka games of rock, paper, scissors).
                You can see a graph of everyone in the university who is playing, and how they are connected.
                There are also leaderboards tracking stuff like the <i>highest number of schnicks</i> and the <i>highest number
                of invited players</i> where you can battle for the #1 spot.
            </p>
